# Usage

This page will summarize all features related to this shop-browser.

## Command

There's just one command, namely `/quickshopsearch <predicate>` - or just `/qss <predicate>`, which will match all globally existing shops against the provided predicate and offer results - if any - within a paginated display. Please familiarize yourself with the syntax of predicates over at the [Parser's Documentation](https://blvckbytes.github.io/docs-item-predicate-parser).

## Paginated Display

The display not only serves results page by page, but also allows to apply further restrictions and preferences; these choices are persisted, in order to ensure lasting personalization. I'll let the following tour speak for itself, which is a result of running the command `/qss ore-? or glass-? or music-? or redstone-? or log-?`.

## Performance Concerns

Since it's totally reasonable to be concerned with the performance-impact a plugin like this could cause, I want to provide some ballpark measurements and insights into the whole process; after all, it's doing a lot: parsing complex predicates, querying **all global shops** and rendering **customizable** preview items.

First and foremost, all of the previously mentioned tasks are executed asynchronously. Secondly, all globally existing shops are queried once on startup and then cached, while newly created or removed shops are of course tracked too; this includes caching not only the remaining stock (as to avoid needless inventory slot scans), but also takes care of the configurable display item template.

Complex predicates take around four to five milliseconds to parse; there's still room for improvement. Where the system shines is the speed of predicate execution, which - for rather complex queries - lies at around 5 nanoseconds per Shop; on a reasonably large server with, for example, 100k shops, a query would take merely half a second.

Rendering a GUI-page, as can be seen in the tour, including page-items and controls, takes around one to two milliseconds. Over all, I believe that the performance of this plugin is within an acceptable range; if you ever encounter any issues, please report back to me, so that I have further motivation to improve efficiency.
